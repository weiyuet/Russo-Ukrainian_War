Inspired by the data sets collected by [Lena Sokol's Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sokolheavy/2022-ukraine-russia-war-visualization) and [Petro Ivanyuk's Kaggle site.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war)
  
Want to understand the costs of war, and the broader picture such as global energy supply and food supply.
