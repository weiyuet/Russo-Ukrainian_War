# russo-ukrainian-war

Numbers from the on-going war in Ukraine. Initially only focused on the casualties (personnel, military wounded and equipment), now expanded to include the economic impacts and food production.

Initially inspired by [`Lena Sokol's Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sokolheavy/2022-ukraine-russia-war-visualization).

War casualty data updated daily from [`Petro Ivanyuk's Kaggle`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/2022-ukraine-russian-war). All data is official and organised by Petro.
